## Overview

### The challenge

The rebuilt portfolio page should demonstrate implementations of:

* Mobile Responsiveness (Media Queries);
* CSS Positioning and Layout;
* Utilization of Flexbox and/or CSS Grid
* CSS Variables
* The repository should also have a basic README.md document.

### Critical Requirements

* When the page is loaded the page presents your name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about you, your work, and how to contact you.
* When one of the links in the navigation is clicked then the UI scrolls to the corresponding
  section
* When viewing the section about your work then the section contains titled images of your
  applications
* When presented with the your first application then that application's image should be larger in size than the others.
* When images of the applications are clicked then the user is taken to that deployed application.
* When the page is resized or viewed on various screens and devices then the layout is responsive and adapts to my viewport
